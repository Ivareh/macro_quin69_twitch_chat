# macro_quin69_twitch_chat

This is an executable that runs persistent. 

When you press `Alt + C` with Quin69's stream on a monitor in focus, your mouse will automatically move to the chat box in the window and click once before going back to original position.

Works regardless if you have multiple monitors. 

Optimized best for fullscreen/near fullscreen.


## How it works:

Script checks for any tabs in an application which says "Quin69 - Twitch". Based on window size, it moves mouse pointer to the chat box's position.
